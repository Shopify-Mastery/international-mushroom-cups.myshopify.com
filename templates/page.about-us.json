I was oftentimes a guinea pig trying new supplements, or diets, or exercise methods.<br\/><br\/>I'll save you the details, but I spent a lot of time detoxing and even needed surgery to reverse negative side effects from artificial supplements that I thought were going to help my body and mind.<\/h5>"

It was a success nobody was hoping for. It was so surprising that we actually had to reschedule our airline tickets to go back home because our Basketball Association assumed we would not get even remotely that far so they booked our flight back, 2 days before the finals. <br\/><br\/>Mushrooms became part of my daily life, my basketball career was on a good track, and my family was there for me as always.<br\/><br\/>But while my focus was aimed in another direction I failed to notice my family also needed me. They were hiding things from me until the situation became desperate. <br\/><br\/>My father who worked in the chemical industry developed a rare form of allergy which made skin on his feet crack all the way to the blood. It looked like the dry desert soil, and you could literally see the blood through the cracks. His feet would often start bleeding just by walking. <br\/>But bleeding wasn’t the scary part. <br\/><br\/>The scary part was accompanying arrhythmia and devastatingly unstable blood pressure which made him a ticking time bomb. He was on the edge of dying at least once a week. <br\/>Diets, medicine, this doctor that doctor, we tried everything. Months were passing but the situation wasn’t getting any better. <br\/><br\/>And as months were passing I became obsessed with helping him.
